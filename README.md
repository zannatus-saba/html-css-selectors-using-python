Selecting CSS Selectors 

I will use data from Wikipedia on the Human Development Index (HDI), a which is a measure based on health, education, and income of a country. This is overseen by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), an international agency associated with the United Nations. The HDI is an indicator of a nation's development, especially related to its citizens. This was introduced as a replacement for GDP, due to GDP's limitation of only assessing economic growth. Below is a table providing the scales used to assess HDI.

Dimensions	Measure	Dimension Index

Long and Healthy Life	Life expectancy at birth	Life Expectancy Index

Knowledge	* Expected years of schooling

* Mean years of schooling	Education Index

Decent Standard of Living	GNI per capita	GNI Index

In the section below, titled Nations, a table lists the HDI scores for every UN member country. Feel free to peruse the contents of this table. I personally find it interesting to see where various countries lie, especially the United States.

Further down the webpage is the section Regions and groups containing a table reporting aggregate HDI scores for regions. For example, Europe and Central Asia is listed between the levels Very high human development and High human development. This table contains 9 columns, with the first column providing the name of the region or group, and the other columns providing HDI region scores for a given year.

Will perform the following tasks given this table of data:

Create CSS selectors for all 9 columns of data. Note, this is not for the table headers, but the actual data contained within the table. You will have a total of 9 CSS selectors

Using a browser, test CSS selectors to ensure you are obtaining the correct data (i.e., use the $$ function in the console). The console should return 15 results because the table contains 15 rows of data.

Save each CSS selector as a string in Python using the following names for the variables 

sel_reg_grp CSS Selector for Region or group

sel_1990 CSS Selector for 1990

sel_2000 CSS Selector for 2000

sel_2010 CSS Selector for 2010

sel_2015 CSS Selector for 2015

sel_2018 CSS Selector for 2018

sel_2019 CSS Selector for 2019

sel_2020 CSS Selector for 2020

sel_2021 CSS Selector for 2021
